This Python Assignment 03 List Tuples and methods .

🎯🚀 Python Assignment 03 Successfully Completed! 🚀🎯

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my Python assignment on Lists, Tuples, and their methods! 🐍💻 This assignment has been an amazing learning experience that has strengthened my fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills while exploring the powerful data structures in Python.

📌 Topics Covered in This Assignment:
🔹✨ Basic List Operations:
✔ Creating & Modifying Lists – Learned how to dynamically manage lists by adding, extending, inserting, and removing elements. 📋
 ✔ Using append(), extend(), insert(), and pop() – Essential list operations for efficient data handling. 🔄
 ✔ Practical List Manipulations – Performing various list operations with real-world applications. 🛠️

🔹🔄 Intermediate List Operations:
✔ Counting Elements – Used count() to find the occurrences of elements within a list. 🔢
 ✔ Sorting Lists – Implemented ascending and descending order sorting using sort() and sorted(). 📊
 ✔ Reversing Lists – Explored reverse() and slicing techniques to manipulate the order of a list. 🔃
 ✔ Copying Lists – Created independent copies of lists and explored mutable vs immutable behavior. 📝
 ✔ Clearing Lists – Used the clear() method to remove all elements efficiently. 🚀

🔹 Tuple-Based Questions:
✔ Creating Tuples – Worked with immutable data structures and accessed elements using indexing. ✅
 ✔ Modifying Tuples (Indirectly) – Explored ways to convert tuples into lists, modify them, and convert them back into tuples. 🔄
 ✔ Unpacking Tuples – Assigned multiple values from a tuple into separate variables for better readability. 📦
 ✔ Counting Tuple Elements – Used count() to determine the number of times a specific element appears in a tuple. 🔢

🔹💡 Advanced Python Challenges:
✔ Filtering Even Numbers – Created a function that removes all even numbers from a list. ⚙️
 ✔ Sorting Without sort() – Implemented sorting logic using loops instead of built-in functions. 🔽
 ✔ Removing Duplicates – Used sets and list comprehensions to extract unique values from a list. 🚀
 ✔ Tuple to List Conversion & Duplicate Removal – Converted a tuple into a list, removed duplicates, and reverted back to a tuple. 🔄
 ✔ Data Type Segregation – Separated integers, strings, and floating-point numbers from a mixed data list. 🧩

🔥 Key Learnings:
 ✨ Lists are mutable and allow dynamic modifications.
 ✨ Tuples are immutable, but can be modified indirectly using conversions.
 ✨ Built-in methods like append(), pop(), and sort() simplify data handling.
 ✨ Tuple unpacking enhances readability and optimizes data retrieval.

Let’s keep coding, innovating, and growing together! 💻🔥
